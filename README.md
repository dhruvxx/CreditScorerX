# CreditScorerX

### To run the files

```bash
$ python3 main.ipynb
```

Credit Scoring models—`Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Logistic Classification`—have been implemented from `scratch` to assist in data-driven lending decisions.

The implementations of the models can be found in the `models` folder. The classifiers are imported to the `main.ipynb` file for modularity and easier maintenance.
