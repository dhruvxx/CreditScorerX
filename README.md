# CreditScorerX

### To run the files

```bash
$ python3 main.ipynb
```

Credit Scoring models—`Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Logistic Classification`—have been implemented from `scratch` to assist in data-driven lending decisions.

The implementations of the models can be found in the `models` folder. The classifiers are imported to the `main.ipynb` file for modularity and easier maintenance. 

## Results
### Accuracy 
1. `Support Vector Machine` - 83.33%
2. `Decision Tree` - 82.50%
3. `Linear Classification` - 82.33%
4. `K-Nearest Neighbors` - 81.50%
